# Basic-Sentiment-Analyzer

This project contain notebooks to train multiple classifiers (Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, Stochastic Gradient Descent) 
to predict the sentiment of a sentence. 

[Labelled dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) of movie reviews is used to train the models.

Atlast, we create an ensemble classifier which encapsulates all the trained models to predict the sentiment of the sentence.
